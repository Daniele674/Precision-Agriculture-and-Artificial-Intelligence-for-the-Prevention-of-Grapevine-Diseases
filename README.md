Bachelor's thesis in computer science titled: Precision Agriculture and Artificial Intelligence for the Prevention of Grapevine Diseases

The objective of this work is to develop a predictive model based on Deep Learning to predict the occurrence of phytopathologies in vineyards, so as to provide winemakers with an effective tool to act in time and counteract plant damage. In this regard, it has been possible to develop a new fully automatic learning method, using convolutional convolutional neural networks through a collection of training datasets.
